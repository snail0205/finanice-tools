Total tax shows what you will likely pay for the year, while effective tax rate provides a reality check against your assumptions. Take-home pay is the number you can use to build a monthly budget. If you are comparing offers, look at the difference in take-home rather than gross salary alone."}]

16:["$","p",null,{"children":"Imagine a $95,000 salary with a $6,000 pre-tax retirement contribution and a 5 percent state tax rate. The calculator shows a lower taxable income and a reduced effective tax rate compared to a scenario without the contribution.

17:["$","p",null,{"children":"If you are comparing a $95,000 offer in a 5 percent tax state against a $90,000 offer in a 0 percent tax state, the tool quickly shows how close the take-home results can be. That kind of clarity can shift the decision from gross salary to overall lifestyle cost."}]

Another mistake is forgetting pre-tax contributions such as 401(k) or HSA, which can significantly lower taxable income. It is also easy to ignore state tax entirely, even though it can be a major part of take-home differences across locations."}]
1e:["$","p",null,{"children":"Use this calculator to test multiple scenarios. For example, try a higher pre-tax contribution to see its impact on taxable income and take-home pay. Also test a small change in state tax rate if you are considering relocation. Personal Finance Helpers are most useful when you compare scenarios rather than rely on a single estimate."}]
1f:["$","p",null,{"children":"Keep in mind that this is a planning estimate. It does not account for itemized deductions, child tax credits, or other specialized cases. If your situation is complex, treat this output as a baseline and consult a tax professional for final filings. For most planning decisions, however, the estimate is accurate enough to guide tradeoffs and budgeting priorities."}]
20:["$","p",null,{"children":"Another point to watch is withholding versus actual tax liability. Payroll withholding is designed to approximate your final tax bill, but bonuses, multiple income streams, or changes during the year can shift results.

21:["$","p",null,{"children":"If you have dependents, itemized deductions, or tax credits, the actual result may be lower than the estimate.
