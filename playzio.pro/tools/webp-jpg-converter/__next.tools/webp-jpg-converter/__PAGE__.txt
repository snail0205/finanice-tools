This workflow keeps compatibility without visible quality loss."}]
4:["$","p",null,{"children":"If your site supports WebP, the opposite case applies. Convert JPG to WebP with a quality setting around 80–85, then compare size reductions. A smaller WebP file speeds up page loads and helps performance metrics without a noticeable drop in clarity."}]

If you need the smallest file, reduce dimensions first and use a moderate quality setting rather than pushing quality too low. Another mistake is expecting transparency to survive JPG conversion; JPG does not support alpha channels."}]
7:["$","p",null,{"children":"When switching to WebP for web performance, start with a quality setting around 80–90 and check the output in real usage. For print or archival use, consider JPG at higher quality. Test two settings to balance size and clarity. A quick comparison is the fastest way to avoid over-compressing."}]
